# Hackathon Submission Materials

## 📝 Submission Description
PromptCraft AI is a Generative UI platform powered by Tambo.

Users describe interfaces in natural language and the system dynamically renders complete React UIs in real time.

Components are registered with Tambo and the AI decides which components to render based on intent. No hardcoded layouts.

**Features:**
• Real-time UI generation
• Templates gallery
• AI suggestions
• Exportable production code
• Premium Linear-style UX

This demonstrates deep integration with Tambo’s Generative UI SDK to create adaptive interfaces.

## 🎤 60-Second Pitch Script
"PromptCraft AI is a Generative UI platform built with Tambo.

Instead of designing interfaces manually, users describe what they want and our AI dynamically renders the correct components in real time.

We register components with Tambo and let the AI decide what to display — no hardcoded layouts.

This allows instant dashboards, chat apps, landing pages, and admin panels.

Think of it as Midjourney for web apps.

From idea to production UI in seconds."
